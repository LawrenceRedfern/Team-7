									<p>For the Myers-Briggs test I feel it correctly described who I am as an individual and the fact I generally don’t mind being at home alone or out in a crowded environment. It also accurately captures the fact that I prefer to take action rather then sit back and observe an issue when I know the solution and that majority of my decisions and acts are based on how I am feeling at that point in time rather then logically thinking things through and this has resulted in some of my biggest regrets and also some of the greatest parts of my life. The test also made clear the fact I tend to not be comfortable with my knowledge and quite often question my work or life as I always have the underlying question on if I am preforming good enough or not.
                  </p>
									<p>I feel these results reflect how I would work in a team as I tend to take lead where I’m comfortable and sit back to listen to others where I may not be as comfortable. I also tend to worry greatly about the mental state of those around me and would go out of my way to make sure everyone is feeling positive and help them to the best of my ability to cheer them up if they are upset. A downside is the fact I don’t put much thought into situations and would require someone there to tell me I’m messing up or that my ideas simply wont work for the project/situation at hand.
                  </p>
									<p>I would choose a logical and somewhat more observant group when forming a team but sacrifice team members who generally give moral support to others or are quite fast to jump the gun when there is a problem rather then sit there and plan through it. As if a group were all people who make decisions based on feelings then a lot of errors would be made, and time would be wasted correcting mistakes and doing things that weren’t required in the first place. If a group had a mix of individuals who have different mindsets on work and how they set out tasks to complete it would flow better. As the slower harder thinking individuals could tell the individuals who tend to make fast decisions that their ideas aren’t the greatest and can explain their reasoning behind it.

									<h2>Creativity Test</h2>
								  </header>
									<a class="image"><img src="images/pic18.jpg" alt="Failed to load image" width='950' height='650'></a>
									<article>
									<p>These results have told me im not as creative as i always thought i was but has also explained some issues that i have had before coming up with ideas for a project and how my website should look. I do feel as though the test has captured the fact i am quite complex and slightly abstract when it comes to my personal taste and my desktop backgroud states this. I use Rainmeter to make my background look clean and slightly strange.
									</p>
									<p>I feel as though me not being super creative could have a negative effect in a team environment but also could stop any conflict between myself and other team members who are more creative as i would find it hard to come up with a idea to challenge their suggestions for a project. In a team based environment i would take the role of someone who does more of the coding then the planning or desing aspects.
								  </p>
									<p>I would make sure i pick team mates who are more creative and are able to put ideas in others head to make sure everyone can see the same picture as them. When forming a team it is important that everyone has their own ways of doing things so that everyone could find the best and most convinent way of making a project work.</p>

									<h2>Learning Styles Test</h2>
								  </header>
									<a class="image"><img src="images/pic17.jpg" alt="Failed to load image" width='655' height='200'></a>
									<article>
									<p>These test results say to me im better at learning when things are show to me rather then spoken. I have had a great issue throughout school learning without a visual demonstration to put context to the lesson. In classed such and math's and science where majority of the learning is visual i excelled and this test has told me the reasoning behind it.
									</p>
									<p>I feel as though these results would make me helping in a group easier as i could pick up on everything that is happening during a lesson while it is shown by the lecturer. I feel like myself being more comfortable with learning through watching a demonstraion would bring a great value to a team as i wont have to ask questions.
									</p>
									<p>I feel as though i would be better with other individuals who also learn visually so we would be able to learn off eachother by looking at each other's code or projects to see what is going on rather then constatly having to google what certain things do and how to make aspects of code do what we would want.</p>
