										<h1>My Project Idea</h1>

										<h2>Smart Mirror</h2>
									</header>

									<article>
									<p>My ideas of a project would be starting to build my own smart home system that links into other smart home systems like Amazon Echo, Phillips HUE, Google Smart Home and others. I would start by building a device that I believe no other company has and that would be a smart mirror linked into a smart beside clock. The mirror would use a screen fit to the size of the mirror that would display weather, time, current music playing, task’s for the day, total sleep time (linked into smart watches or other equipment to make that possible) and could possibly order food using uber eats or even start your other smart home items that you generally use in the morning.

									<p>My motivation behind this project was seeing a youtuber do a smart mirror but not to the extent I’m planning on making mine. His was a simple smart mirror that used a Raspberry Pi to display information but as far as I can recall it wasn’t able to connect to other smart home systems other then Amazon Echo. I seen the video and had the idea of making my own smart home mirror but making it compatible with a lot of other smart home items and then making a product out of it if everything went well. I was not surprised when I discovered how difficult this would be but that inspired me even more as I love a challenge.

									<p>This product would have smart home features such as displaying the time, weather, important notifications, current music playing and voice recognition. The project would be a quick way to check the time and weather while preparing for work or school. You could find out current traffic details while still having both hands free to prepare yourself and make sure your looking the best you can for the day ahead. The project will have an RGB strip on the outside for lighting a room if needed but also to have a physical indication that Alexa is listening as Alexa would be the main voice assistant due to most smart home products already being linked to the Amazon Echo. A feature I would include would be a traffic update with an image of the current area of 5 kilometres that would have roads in different colours to mark their current traffic conditions and would also display the shortest route to your destination. The mirror would talk to the bed side alarm clock and while waking up the alarm clock could tell you how long you have to get ready to make it to work/school on time taking into account the current traffic conditions. I would integrate a motion sensor in the mirror that would detect when someone is in front of the mirror and would display all the information generally used when someone uses the mirror and that information would be user based. If you had a smart coffee machine and had it connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your mirror and alarm clock then while your getting ready it would tell your coffee machine to prepare your morning coffee so all you need to do is prepare for work and not use your phone to start the coffee machine. I would also integrate a smoke detector and heat monitor inside the mirror that would communicate to the alarm clock. In the event that the mirror has a terrible error and starts to catch fire the alarm clock would begin to play a loud high-pitched sound to wake everyone up in the house and would immediately contact emergency services. The alarm clock would also use all Amazon Echo devices inside the home to play the alarm sound and display the light ring for a form of lighting in the house in-case the house becomes filled with smoke. If you have smart lighting in your home the alarm clock would also make them turn on at 100% brightness displaying white to punch through the smoke and make it safer to travel the home. The heat and smoke detector would also cut all power to the mirror as soon as they are tripped to try to prevent a fire. This smart mirror would not only help you prepare in the morning while gathering useful information it will also help you sleep at night knowing that in-case of a fire it would help you survive and contact emergency services for you so you have nothing to worry about.

									<p>Required hardware would be an LCD monitor/tv (resolution is not important as it is a mirror not a display to watch movies, videos etc.) and a Raspberry Pi for the computing of the actions preformed. It would also require a WIFI adapter to connect to other smart home systems and a built-in microphone for using voice activated commands. Speakers would be installed for responses to voice commands. It would also require an AUX port for connecting external speaks in case you would like to use it to play music. I would also have to install an internal power supply to make all the comments run and make sure they all had enough power.

									<p>This project would require me to be able to setup hardware and wire everything properly so I would need the knowledge of how to setup electronics. I would also require the skills to code in whatever language most smart home devices are coded in and be able to pair them up through Wi-Fi.  I would also require the knowledge of how to mount a screen behind a 1 way mirror without damaging part and maxing sure everything has enough breathing room to stay cool while also having everything in a position that will be easy to access in case I need to change out a part. The required skills are feasible and would be quite easy to gather the skill required for this project.

									<p>I feel as though if this project was successful and the word about it got out there then other smart home companies could come out with similar products and create another highly useful smart home system and could make companies look at other household devices that could be automated for the ease of end users life and make life simpler if you could check valuable information while simultaneously getting ready for work or school so you wouldn’t waste time using your phone for this information. I t could also be used in a work place as a message board in the staff rooms with live updates from manager’s, ect.
