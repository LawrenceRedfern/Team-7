									<h2>Who am i?</h2>
									<article>
									<p>My name is Lawrence Redfern. I am 18 years old and love computers. My fondest memories with computers was play CS with my cousin. When i was young i was making batch games.
										 I always thought because i could write batch i was a coding god (Oh how wrong i was). At the age of 15 i attempted to write a javascript game and well lets say that didn't go to well.</p>
									<p>I am currently studying at RMIT University with the hopes to complete a batcholers degree in IT. My student number is s3748752. I currently live in Townsville but i used to live in Darwin with my friends.
									I used to work on fishing traulers as a way of making money but now i have decided to do something i love and pursue my dream career in Information and Tehcnology.</p>
									<p>I currently have a daughter who means the absolute world to me and i want nothing but the best for her so i am determained to pass all courses i do so that i can better provide for her.
									I generally play Rocket League alot and get way to worked up over it.</p>

									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
								  </header>
									<article>
									<p>I love the coding side of IT (even though it is frustrating at times) due to the fact that i can watch in real time the changed take place and see the progress im making.
									   My intrest in IT was truly sparked by my cousin who i used to play CS with. I then got into pc gaming really heavy until i discorvered mods for minecraft (I was 11) and started learning about how to mod games.
									   Then my interest changed from moding games to writting batch games and programs and that is where i truly got my passion for writting code and seeing it take effect in real time.
									   I still have the windows shutdown code stuck in my head after deciding to prank my whole school and shutdown the school server's through remote access and then shutdown all computers in the school.
									   My teachers didnt think this was funny and i was internally suspended for 2 months.</p>
									<p>I chose to study at RMIT due to the ease of studying online and flexibility required. RMIT was also the only uni doing a batcholers in IT through OUA and that is another reason i decided to start my studies with RMIT.
									   I have been quite happy while studying at RMIT and enjoy the structure and simplicity of the canvas site.</p>
									<p>I expect to learn advanced coding and how to put together games, apps, websites and even devices. I hope that i can learn about hardware as much as software to better help in my future career goals.</p>

									<p>This job is a web development position that consists of using languages like HTML,  JavaScript, CSS and PHP and creating business related web products and making sure the end user has a enjoyable experience while also maintaining a high level of security and diversity between each product making every website stand out and be its own. This job also offers working with large well-known companies to offer them a great website that could set a new standard of quality in the online market.</p>
									<p>This position caught my eye because I love programming and always challenging myself with a new way of creating a product using code. I feel as though working on websites that have a great meaning to some of the largest companies in the country would be a fun yet challenging experience. I’m also attracted the base salary as it is quite a comfortable starting salary in an amazing part of Australia. I have always loved Queensland and this position being in the beautiful gold coast would make for a lovely living experience as well as a wonderful job.</p>
									<p>This job has the requirement of someone who is quite skilled with PHP, HTML, Java and CSS as well as being comfortable working on large projects as their clients appear to be well-known Australian businesses and would require quite a unique and challenging website when coupled with the security. With these clients being well-known only individuals who have a proven track record and a vast range of skills in the website creation side of programming would get this position.   </p>
									<p>I currently have very little skills in the programming world but know some of the basics suck as how to create links, photos, paragraphs, headers, titles, text boxes and displaying media such as videos.
									</p>
									<p>To obtain the required skills and experience for this position I would firstly base majority of my study around website creation and become quite comfortable with making websites fast and proficiently. Next, I would search for a job working on websites that isn’t full time or isn’t a position where I would be working on big name companies websites and be working in a small group to better understand the tools used and languages used to make great websites.
