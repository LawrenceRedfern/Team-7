				<h2>Career Plans</h2>
				<h3>David Pipczak</h3>
				<p>Majority of the team at ‘Thank God its Pi Day (TGIPD)’ have a very similar ideals for their future, they have a very similar career plans and are closely based around web design, other members of TGIPD are looking towards a future career in cyber security and Senior network engineer. The web design careers have common skills that will be required such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and at the same time they have difference. One of the differences between the web development careers is that one of the team is looking at moving in at a junior web developer level, another of the team is looking at a PHP web developer and will require this extra skill, the last member who is looking for a career in web development is looking at a lead web developer and will require many more extra skills like experience in Node.JS, experience with both React and Redux, will need good communication skills and be able to plan and lead a team. The TGIPD team member that is looking towards a career in Cyber Security will require different skills from the web developers like NIST security standards, DHS Cyber security frameworks, Threat protection(ATP & ENS), Windows Group Policy, be able to configure, operate and maintain the cyber equipment. The last team member who is working towards a career as a senior network engineer will be looking more at the infrastructure, building infrastructure programs like (EWO/EO/PTW), Platform design, IP Networking, VOIP, and telecommunications.</p>
				</br>
				<h3>Johnathon Tassoni</h3>
				<p>The members of TGIP are seeking careers in fields that are quite similar, with the majority of the members are excited to purse careers that are centric to the web. While the only role that is slightly different is
					the Cyber Security role, all members are looking to become proficient with programming abilities and to utilise them in the IT industry.</p>
					</br>
				<h3>Lawrence Redfern</h3>
				<p>TGIPD'S Carrer plans are quite similar as the majority of the ideal jobs are based around the internet and web development. The biggest difference that is noticed almost instantly is that the majority of the group have decided to pursue a web-based job and Johnno has decided to pursue a Cyber Security job. smaller differences are the type of programming used in the job. My career plan is quite similar to the rest of the group as we all seem to be pursuing a job in the web industry.
				</p></br>
				<h3>Laim Chan-Wicht</h3>
				<p>Most of TGIPD's members are interested in the web development side of programming, with the exception of Mitch and Johnno. Their career aspirations are more geared toward the engineering aspect of programming, with interests in software/cyber security and network engineering respectively. Commonality between all these specialties is not far or few between, with the need for problem solving, creative thinking and effective sprint methodologies shared amongst them all. These skills are further reinforced in our chosen field of study and will serve us all in the years to come. </br>
					Differences are made more apparent as we start to break down what it really means to be a Software Engineer or a UI Designer. Whilst we are all coding and working in a digital space, the languages we 'speak', programs we use, and the problems we solve will differ from job to job. Asking one to complete the other's job will be as efficient as hamming with a screwdriver - sure, they're both tools but not the right one for the job.
				</p></br>
				<h3>Mitchell Lee</h3>
				<p>The members of our Team are all interested in careers in differing areas of the IT industry. Throughout our collaborations on assessments we have been able to further expand the scope of each others career prospects.
					Altho the careers we are considering are in many different areas of the Industry, many of the core values remain the same, whether it be programs used or the the language coded in.
					The trend amongst the group seems to be a career based on the web industry/development sector.</p>
