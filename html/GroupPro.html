				<h2>Group Processes</h2>
				<h3>David Pipczak</h3>
				<p>The group worked quite well together on assignment 2, the group come together early and set out achievable realistic goals, they used communication tools such as discord, Trello and GitHub to bring it all together, and even though there was one absent group member, the team kept on pushing through and working hard, the team did not let this stop them and since that time the absent team member had removed himself from the course and our team.</p>
				<h3>Johnathon Tassoni</h3>
				<p>The group worked together very well for Assignment 2. All group members were welcoming and inclusive and all members were able to complete their individual tasks on time.
					The group quickly organised a method of communication and a way to share completed task work. Unfortunately there was a case of an absent team member, but the team was able to overcome
					this hurdle and pull together. At the conclusion of Assignment 2, the group decided that it would be best to have more frequent communication going forward for assignment 3.</p>
				<h3>Lawrence Redfern</h3>
				<p>The group worked hand in hand for assignment 2 and dealt with the inactive member in the best way possible. We all completed our duties well before the deadline and used the remaining time to read over everything and make sure it was what we envisioned. I feel as though a more frequent meeting would be best for the group and allowing the group to make changes to others work where the whole group sees fit.</p>
				<h3>Liam Chan-Wicht</h3>
				<p>We worked quite well together and managed to finish our assigned duties well within deadline. The non-responsive member has been removed and I would like to have more of an iterative process where we can all refine each others work - maybe through a trello board or something similar</p>
				<h3>Mitchell Lee</h3>
				<p>Our group came together after having to deal with an inactive member and pulled through with an amazing presentation utilising the skills of our group members & websites and software such as Trello for organisation, Github for our project distribution & Discord for staying in contact and developing our ideas together.</p>
