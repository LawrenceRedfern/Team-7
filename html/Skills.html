				<h2>Skills And Jobs</h2>
		</br>
				<!-- David -->
				<h3>David Pipczak</h3>
				<p>Group #7â€™s team is being led by our project manager/ lead developer David Pipczak, David is to over see the progress of the project and communicate and advice the team on time lines, directions, commissioning and alterations if and when they are needed.</p>
				<p>Hardware developer and engineer Mitchell lee will be overseeing the assembly and giving instruction to correctly communicate with the serial device, Mitchell will also be tech support for any hardware issues during and after the project.</p>
				<p>Graphics user interface design and layout will be provided by Liam Chan-Wicht, Liam will liaise and communicate with David to ensure that the GUI design is meeting the request and requirements of the customer news corporation Australia.</p>
				<p>Johnathon Tassoni will be lead programmer with support from Lawrence Redfern, Johnathon will provide the programming structure to create the software for the GUI designed by Liam Chan-Wicht while Lawrence will program file storage systems.
					</br>Johnathon and Lawrence will also provide relevant documentation for the use and operation of the device.</p>
		</br>

					<!-- Johnno -->
				<h3>Johnathon Tassoni</h3>
				<p>For our project we will need:</p>
				<p>Project manager : The role of the project manager will be to lead and co-ordinate the group. They will be responsible for ensuring that all members are keeping on schedule with their allocated task
					and managing the team members. They should have a clear picture of where the project is at and what needs to be done next.</p>
				<p>Hardware engineer : As we are utilising a Raspberry Pi - we will need someone who is proficient with the technology. They will have to have a firm understanding of the components of the Pi and how to solve
					and hardware issues associated with it.</p>
				<p>Software developer/Programmer : we require a member who specialises in programming to be able to program the functionality required. It would be preferable for the team member to have a large amount
					of programming experience under their belt and to have knowledge of integrating the hardware of the Raspberry Pi with their program.</p>
				<p>Graphic Designer : As we must pitch/sell our project we will need someone to handle the design of the teams logos, website graphics and any further graphics required for official team documents. They should
					have knowledge and be proficient with multiple graphic software (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc).</p>
		</br>

				<!-- Lawrence -->
				<h3>Lawrence Redfern</h3>
				<p>David Pipczak- Project manager. David is the one who came up with the original idea for the project so I feel it is best that he was to oversee the whole operation making sure it goes the way he planned.</p>
				<p>Liam chan-wicht- Graphic designer. Liam is a talented graphic designer and his work has helped the group make the website more personal and he could do great work with funding.</p>
				<p>Mitch Lee- Hardware Engineer. Mitch is an intelligent guy who seems to have a great knowledge of hardware and would be able to make the majority of the project's hardware without issues.</p>
				<p>Johnno Tassoni- Software Developer. Johnno is a great guy who can learn quite fast so I feel that having him as the software developer would be greatly beneficial as he would be able to learn the required language quite fast and make the code flawless.</p>
		</br>

				<!-- Liam -->
				<h3>Liam Chan-Wicht</h3>
				<p>4 Person Team (with fear of sounding redundant):</p>
				<p>Hardware Engineer: The Raspberry Pi is a particular piece of hardware that we have chosen to use to fix this problem. Someone with knowledge of the ins and outs of the hardware will be needed to successfully deliver.</p>
				<p>Software Engineer: Whilst the hardware engineer will have some capability with the interaction of the Raspberry Pi, a software engineer will have a greater knowledge of interactions between programs and lines of code. This person will have to be as knowledgeable as the hardware engineer to effectively interact with the Pi and other software/hardware.</p>
				<p>Project Lead: This role must be filled by someone who can organise themselves as well as the other team members. In production, deadlines must be met and the project lead is the person to encourage the members to push for these deadlines. They must also have a clear understanding of how the project is progressing and how each interaction will affect the outcome of the product.</p>
				<p>General Purpose Designer: In front of all the code and hardware, there must be a bright shiny box/website/label/EDM/piece of advertising that alerts other potential investors to the product. Knowledge of the Adobe suite will be beneficial, as well as knowledge of wire-framing, prototyping and other modeling processes.</p>
		</br>

				<!-- Mitch -->
				<h3>Mitchell Lee</h3>
				<p>Our team will be headed up by the following people completing the roles they're strongest in while communicating with other members to ensure an always favourable end result while utilising our chosen hardware.</p>
				<p>Project Leader- David Pipczak </br>
					David will be heading up all projects in the present & the future. David is a very capable and thorough leader with the initiative and the drive to make sure things are done on time and deadlines are always met.</p>
				<p>Graphics & Design - Liam Chan-Wicht </br>
					Liam will be undertaking all Graphics design and implementation for the projects. Liam will work in tandem with David and other members of the team to bring his creativity to the table.</p>
				<p>Software Engineering & Development - Lawrence Redfern & Johnno Tassoni </br>
					The software engineering and development will be headed up by Johnno & Lawrence. Their expertise in the software side will ensure our hardware is always compatible with our software.</p>
				<p>Hardware Development & Engineering - Mitch Lee </br>
					Mitch will be working directly with Johnno & Lawrence to ensure all hardware works with the implementations in the software.
					Mitch will also work with David & Liam to organise & carry out all rollouts and design changes to the end product throughout the duration of the project</p>
